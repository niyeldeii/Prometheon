# **Prometheon Reactor Design**

This repository contains the **design model**, **early-stage software components**, and a supporting **paper** making the case for the Prometheon Reactorâ€”a decentralized bioenergy system designed to transform agricultural and bio-based waste into energy and valuable byproducts.

The focus of this repository is on showcasing the **conceptual design**, **software framework**, and **technical rationale** for the reactor's role in waste management and renewable energy generation.

---

## **Overview**
The **Prometheon Reactor** is an innovative solution aimed at addressing global waste and energy challenges by:
- **Converting agricultural waste** into syngas, biochar, and briquettes.
- **Generating electricity** through Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs).
- **Promoting sustainability** by reducing waste and producing renewable energy.

This repository includes:
- A **design model** to visualize the reactor structure.
- Early-stage **software concepts**, including AI-based sorting and optimization tools.
- A **PDF paper** that outlines the scientific, environmental, and economic rationale for the reactor.
